# Tower Defence game with C++ CMUgraphics library
A simple simulation game for my university Data Structures and algorithms course. To run the game, compile and run ```Demo_Main.cpp``` in VisualStudio.
This will launch a demo for the game. You can either progress in the game by consecutive mouse clicks or editing the ```Demo_Main.cpp``` to progress automatically
